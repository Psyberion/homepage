A neat, dynamic and easily customizable homepage for your browser

Contents of this repo
=====================
The code is available in two versions; the code in ``src/`` is just show the
basic layout with a very basic colouring scheme, while ``example/`` contains
a solarized version.

Installation
============

Copy ``src/`` to wherever you want to keep your home page, edit a couple of
files to your liking, and set it as your home page in your browser.

The files you should edit are:

* ``src/js/conf.js``
* ``src/js/colors.js``
* ``src/css/theme.css``

If you don't like the quotes being set as the page title you should edit
``src/js/quote.js`` as well. Instructions for how the files are formatted
are written in the comments for each file.

Screenshot
